# belly-button-challenge

I began working on this projec tby following the templet provided to us. 
Building the metadata panel was tough and i lean on the Xpert Learning assitance to guide me on how to do it. The Xpert learning assitant help me form the function to loop and obtain the key-values in the filtered metadata. 
With buiding both charts i received help from a totur to for hte functions to filter the samples for the object. The tutor assitated me to correct how i built the bubble chart. The bar char i based my work from past examples from class. 
wiht the portion of building the function to run on the page i received help from Xpert Learning. I created my funcitons based examples it was giving me.
